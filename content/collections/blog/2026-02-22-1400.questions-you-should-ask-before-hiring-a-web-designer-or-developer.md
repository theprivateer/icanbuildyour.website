Hiring a web designer or developer is one of those decisions that's easy to rush.

You compare a few portfolios, look at prices, and hope for the best.

A better approach is to ask a few clear questions up front. Not to catch anyone out, but to understand how they work and whether the relationship is likely to be a good fit.

Here are some questions worth asking, and why each one matters.

## "How will this project actually run?"

This question reveals a lot.

You're looking to understand:

- how communication works    
- how often you'll hear from them
- how progress is tracked
- what happens when decisions are needed

A clear answer suggests a considered process. A vague one often leads to confusion later.

You don't need a rigid system, but you do need to know what to expect.

## "What do you need from me, and when?"

Website projects stall when expectations aren't clear.

This question helps you understand:

- how much time you'll need to be involved    
- what inputs are critical
- where delays commonly happen

A good answer shows that the person has done this before and understands the client side of the project, not just the technical work.

## "How do you handle changes during the project?"

Almost every project changes once it's underway.

This question isn't about avoiding change. It's about understanding how it's handled.

Listen for:

- how scope changes are discussed    
- whether there's flexibility
- how costs or timelines are adjusted

Clear change management prevents awkward conversations later.

## "What happens after the site goes live?"

This is one of the most important and most overlooked questions.

You want to know:

- whether support is included
- how fixes or updates are handled
- who you contact if something breaks
- whether maintenance is expected or optional

A website isn't finished at launch. Knowing what happens next protects you from being left on your own.

## "Who owns the website and the accounts?"

Ownership matters more than people realise.

This question helps clarify:

- who controls hosting and domains
- who has admin access
- whether you can move providers later

Clear ownership avoids lock-in and gives you confidence that the site is truly yours.

## "How do you approach accessibility and usability?"

You don't need technical detail here.

What you're listening for is whether they think about:

- real users
- mobile experiences
- clarity and ease of use
- inclusive design

A thoughtful answer suggests they're designing for people, not just screens.

## "What does success look like for this project?"

This question shifts the focus away from features and toward outcomes.

It helps align expectations around:

- what the site is meant to achieve    
- how decisions will be judged
- what "done" actually means

If success isn't clearly defined, it's hard to know whether the project has delivered value.

## "Can you explain your recommendations in plain language?"

This isn't a test. It's a signal.

If someone can explain their thinking clearly, they're more likely to be a good long-term partner. If everything relies on jargon, collaboration often suffers.  

You should feel informed, not talked down to.

## The goal isn't perfect answers

There's no single right way to build a website.

The goal of these questions is to understand how someone thinks, communicates, and works with clients. That's often more important than the tools they use.

A good fit feels clear, respectful, and aligned with how you like to work.

## If you're planning a website project and want clarity upfront

If you're considering a new website and want to understand what a healthy working relationship looks like before you commit, I'm happy to help.

I work with clients who value clear communication, sensible expectations, and support beyond launch.

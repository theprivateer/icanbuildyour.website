    title: 'Web design and development that works for your business'
    content: |-
      I design and build websites for small to medium sized businesses that want something dependable, fast, and easy to manage. With over 20 years of professional experience, I focus on doing the fundamentals properly so your website supports your business instead of getting in the way.

      I am a freelance web designer and developer, which means you work directly with the person building your site. No hand-offs, no confusion, and no disappearing acts.

    title: 'Websites for growing businesses of all kinds'
    content: |-
      I work with a wide range of small businesses and organisations, including:

      - Local service providers and trades
      - Professional services such as consultants, accountants, and agencies
      - Retail businesses and e-commerce stores
      - Creatives, studios, and independent professionals
      - Community organisations and small teams

      Whether you need a simple informational site, a content-driven website, or an online store, I tailor the solution to suit your goals and budget rather than forcing you into a one-size-fits-all setup.

    title: 'Clean design, strong SEO, and solid performance'
    content: |-
      A good website should load quickly, be easy to use, and make sense to both people and search engines. I focus on clean, uncluttered design paired with well-structured code that performs well across devices and connection speeds.

      Search engine optimisation is built in from the start, not bolted on later. That means clear page structure, meaningful content, fast load times, and technical foundations that help search engines understand your site.

      Performance is not just a technical detail. Faster websites keep visitors engaged, reduce drop-offs, and tend to rank better in search results. Every decision, from layout to code, is made with performance in mind.

    title: 'Accessibility is part of quality, not an extra'
    content: |-
      Accessibility is a core part of how I build websites. That includes keyboard navigation, screen reader support, readable content, and sensible interaction patterns.

      An accessible website reaches more people, works better in more situations, and is easier to maintain long term. It also reduces risk as accessibility expectations and legal requirements continue to evolve.

    title: 'You own your content, always'
    content: |-
      Your website should belong to you, not be locked behind a platform or a vendor. I build sites where you fully own your content, your data, and your hosting.

      That means no forced subscriptions, no proprietary editors you cannot leave, and no surprises later. You are free to move, grow, and change direction without rebuilding from scratch.

    title: 'Easy updates with Statamic'
    content: |-
      I use the [Statamic](https://statamic.com) content management system to give you flexibility without complexity. Statamic is fast, secure, and a pleasure to use. Updating text, images, products, or pages is straightforward, even if you are not technical.

      It works well for brochure sites, content-heavy websites, and e-commerce, and it scales as your needs grow. You can manage your site confidently, knowing it will stay fast and reliable.

      If you prefer, I am also happy to handle updates and ongoing support for you.

    title: 'Fair pricing, honest advice'
    content: |-
      My services are competitively and fairly priced. I focus on long-term value rather than shortcuts. You will get clear advice, realistic timelines, and a website built to last.

      If something is not the right fit for your situation, I will tell you. The goal is to build something useful and sustainable, not just something that looks good on launch day.
